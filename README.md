# EXP 4 Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques- Lab Scenario: Smart Health Assistant System
# Description: 
## Background:
You are part of a development team working on an AI-based Smart Health Assistant named "MediGuide" that assists elderly patients in managing chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis. The assistant must provide tailored health advice, medication reminders, daily tips, and emotional support through natural language conversations.

## Objective:
Develop a scenario-based report that demonstrates how diverse prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based, and multi-modal prompts) can be used to optimize MediGuide’s responses in different use cases.

# Algorithm:

# 1. Zero-Shot Prompting:

## Definition:
 The model responds to a user prompt without prior examples.The model is expected to generate a response based on its pre-existing knowledge and understanding

## Use Case 1: Symptom Concern

User Input: “I feel dizzy after breakfast.”

## Prompt:
 “Give a reason for dizziness after eating in elderly diabetic patients.”

## Response:

"Dizziness after meals could indicate postprandial hypotension or a blood sugar imbalance. It's advised to monitor your blood pressure and sugar levels, and consult your doctor if this happens frequently."

## Use Case 2: Quick Tip

User Input: “Tell me something healthy I can do today.”

## Prompt:
 “Provide one health tip for elderly patients with arthritis.”

## Response:

"Stretch your joints for 5–10 minutes in the morning. Gentle movement can ease stiffness."

Strengths: Simple and quick.

Limitations: Lacks personalization.

# 2. Few-Shot Prompting

## Definition: 
The model is guided using a few input-output examples.This technique helps the model generalize from the examples to new, similar tasks. Learn Prompting

## Use Case: Food Recommendations for Health Conditions
Prompt Template:

## Q: What should a diabetic person have for breakfast?

A: Oatmeal with nuts and no added sugar.

## Q: What’s a good lunch for a person with high blood pressure?

A: Grilled vegetables and quinoa with low-sodium dressing.

## Q: What should I have for dinner if I have both diabetes and arthritis?

## Response:

"Grilled salmon with steamed broccoli and sweet potato is a great option. It’s anti-inflammatory and helps regulate blood sugar."

Strengths: Personalized and pattern-aware.


Limitations: Requires curated examples.

# 3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

## Definition: 
The model is encouraged to reason step-by-step.Chain-of-thought prompting encourages the AI to break down its reasoning into a series of
intermediate steps, enhancing its ability to handle complex tasks.

## Use Case: Overdose Management
User Input: “I think I took my arthritis medicine twice.”

## Prompt:
 “Think step-by-step to handle accidental double dosing in elderly arthritis patients.”

## Response:

"First, identify the medication type. NSAIDs like ibuprofen in double dose may cause stomach irritation or kidney stress. Do not take more. Watch for nausea or dizziness. Contact your doctor or emergency care 
immediately."

Strengths: Logical, safe, multi-step reasoning.


Limitations: Can be long for simple queries.

# 4. Role-Based Prompting

## Definition: 
The model takes on a specific persona, e.g., doctor, caregiver, friend.

## Use Case 1: Emotional Comfort

User Input: “I’m feeling lonely today.”

## Prompt:

 “You are MediGuide, a friendly and compassionate companion. Respond empathetically.”

## Response:

"I’m sorry you're feeling that way. You're not alone — I’m here with you. Want to talk, play music, or maybe call a loved one?"

## Use Case 2: Daily Motivation

## Prompt: 

“You are a wellness coach. Encourage the user to move more today.”

## Response:

"Let’s try just 5 minutes of stretching. Movement lifts your mood and strengthens your body. You can do it!"

Strengths: Empathetic and human-like.


Limitations: Needs strong persona design to avoid inconsistency.

# 5. Multi-Modal Prompting

## Definition: The model responds to inputs beyond text — images, audio, video.

## Use Case 1: Prescription Label Interpretation
User Uploads: Image of a pill bottle.

## Prompt:

“Read the image and explain dosage instructions for a diabetic patient.”

## Response:

"This prescription says: Metformin 500mg, take one tablet after breakfast and dinner. I’ll set reminders for 9 AM and 7 PM."

## Use Case 2: Symptom via Voice Input

User Voice Note: “My chest feels heavy and I’m sweating.”

## Prompt:
 “Transcribe and analyze this for potential heart emergency.”

## Response:

"Your symptoms may be cardiac-related. Please call emergency services or visit the nearest hospital immediately."

Strengths: Real-world input support


Limitations: Requires integrated tools for image/voice recognition

# Future Enhancements:


Context-Aware Memory: Maintain conversation history to personalize care.

Sensor Integration: Real-time vitals from smartwatches (e.g., heart rate, glucose).

Multilingual Chat: Support regional Indian and global languages.

Caregiver Dashboard: Allow family/doctors to monitor conversations for alerts.

# Result

Diverse prompting techniques — zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based, and multi-modal — greatly improve MediGuide’s interaction quality. By tailoring its responses to the specific needs, contexts, and input modalities of elderly users, MediGuide becomes a reliable, empathetic, and intelligent virtual companion.
